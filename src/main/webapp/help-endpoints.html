This plugin allows you to publish applications to a Relution Enterprise Appstore as part of the
build process. To do so, add the configuration for one or more stores here, then add the post-build
action <b>Deploy to Relution Enterprise Appstore</b> to a job. You can then select one of the
stores configured here from a drop down list to automatically upload your application file to
this store whenever a build process completes.
