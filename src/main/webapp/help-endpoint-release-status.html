Select the default application status that should be used when uploading an application file. This
setting can be overridden on each job's configuration page.
<br/><br/>
Applications in <i>Development</i> are typically only available to developers. When a developer is
satisfied with their work they can move the application to <i>Review</i>. Once an application has
passed review it can then be moved to <i>Release</i>.
<br/><br/> 
Per default, applications are uploaded to <i>Development</i> and must be manually moved to another
status through Relution's web interface. Changing the status here allows you to skip this step,
e.g. when you do not review your applications prior to release (i.e. your customers are your beta
testers).
