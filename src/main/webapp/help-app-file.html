The path to the artifact that you want to upload to the Relution Enterprise Appstore, relative to
the workspace directory. This is typically an Apple iOS (.ipa) or Google Android (.apk) binary. You
can specify a wildcard as part of the file's name (e.g. "build/apk/*-release.apk"), however the
wildcard cannot appear as part of a directory's name.
